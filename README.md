# Efficiency-Question
This was provided as an interview question for a Software Developer position.

The company gave a segment of this code as an example and wanted you to make it more efficient. They asked for the results of the inputs of 7, 17, and 90.  The original code canâ€™t run 90 efficiently.  The specialMath.py file is my solution to this problem.
